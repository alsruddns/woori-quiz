# Woori Quiz language expansion progress

Progress is measured from the source catalog and localization quality checks. A locale is complete only when common UI and every public quiz are localized, routing and quiz behavior work, and metadata, sitemap, TypeScript, lint, tests, and production build pass. Incomplete locales stay out of routing and indexing.

## Scope and current counts

- Repository identified as **Woori Quiz** (`woori-quiz`, branch `develop`).
- Target: 26 locales: `ko`, `en`, `ja`, `zh`, `es`, `pt-br`, `de`, `fr`, `vi`, `id`, `th`, `zh-tw`, `it`, `nl`, `hi`, `ar`, `bn`, `fil`, `ms`, `pl`, `ru`, `sv`, `tr`, `uk`, `ur`, `fa`.
- Quiz registry: 96 entries, 58 public quizzes, 38 closed entries.
- Shared question bank: 621 records. UI, route and publication completion is counted separately from question data.
- 15 locales are currently published: Korean, English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, French, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Italian, Dutch, and Hindi. Sitemap contains 885 URLs (15 list pages and 870 detail pages).

## Locale progress

“Question copy” includes static translations and generated pattern copies. “UI catalog” means source entries exist and are wired; it does not imply quality approval. Published page count is list pages plus quiz detail pages.

| Locale | Question copy | UI catalog | UI quality | Published pages | SEO |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| ko | 621/621 | Connected | Pass | 59 | Pass |
| en | 621/621 (source) | Connected | Pass | 59 | Pass |
| ja | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| zh | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| es | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| pt-br | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| de | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| fr | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| vi | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| id | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| th | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| zh-tw | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| it | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| nl | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| hi | 621/621; 0 question gaps | Connected | Pass | 1 + 58 | Pass |
| ar | 621/621 staged; not connected | Missing | Structural check pass; runtime not verified | 0 | Not published |
| bn, fil, ms, pl, ru, sv, tr, uk, ur, fa | 0/621 | Missing | Not verified | 0 | Not published |

The existing non-English catalogs need a fresh audit. The earlier “390/621” values are the pre-expansion baseline, not proof of completion. Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, French, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Italian, Dutch, and Hindi pass common UI and question coverage, all 58 public quiz gates, routing, selector, canonical/hreflang, and sitemap checks. Other incomplete languages remain out of routes, selectors, hreflang, and sitemap.

## Verification and next start point

- Question localization suites cover all 621 records with zero gaps for Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, French, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Italian, Dutch, and Hindi; patterned questions preserve stable answer positions, historical dates, and science symbols.
- TypeScript: passed (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`).
- Lint: passed (`pnpm lint`).
- Full test suite: **61/61 passed** (`pnpm test`), including 621-question coverage for Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, French, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Italian, Dutch, and Hindi; route, selector, SEO, sitemap, scoring, and mobile UI checks.
- Production build: passed (`pnpm build`); 907 paths generated, including 15 localized list pages and 870 quiz detail routes.
- Incomplete-target publication guard: all 11 not-yet-connected targets are checked for absence from generated routes, published hreflang, and sitemap list/detail URLs. Focused localization tests passed (11/11), TypeScript passed, and lint passed after this guard change.
- Arabic question copy: 621/621 records are staged in `src/lib/question-bank/locales/ar/question-bank.json`; a structural test checks IDs, nonempty Arabic question/explanation copy, option count and uniqueness, and unchanged English language-test choices. It is not connected to runtime, and no Arabic pages are published.

**Next start:** Connect the staged Arabic question copy to runtime, then add and verify Arabic UI, titles, interactive tests, RTL layout, routing, SEO, and remaining quiz behavior. Keep it unpublished until all gates pass. The other ten new targets have no connected data yet (0/621 each). Hindi and the other completed languages are public. Prior locale commits and the publication-guard update are pushed to `origin/develop`.
